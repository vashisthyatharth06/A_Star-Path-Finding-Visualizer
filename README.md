# A-Path-Finding-Visualization
A python visualization of the A* path finding algorithm(GUI).
It allows you to pick your start and end location (one can also make as many as possible obstructions between start and end location) 
and view the process of finding the shortest path through A* path finding algorithm.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TKinter
- Pygame
- Knowledge of A* path finding algorithm(one of the best and advanced technique used in path-finding and graph traversals).
